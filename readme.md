# ReadMe Generator 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to create an application to generate a Readme through the command line.  This
application is supposed to make submitting projects a breeze.  By using the fils system inquirer prompts we are able 
to answers questions through the command line that are linked to a markdown template file.  The template file contains a
markdown template with links in the correct places for the answers to your prompts to sit.  Once the prompts are answered
a README file is generated in the disttibution(dist) directory.
